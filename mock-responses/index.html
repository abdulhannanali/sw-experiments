            <h1>Mock Response API</h1>
            <p>
                This demo uses ServiceWorker to mock responses for an API.
                ServiceWorker acts as a network proxy, and therefore can be 
                used to get fixed mock responses, to respond with.

                This uses a special header known as <code>X-Mock-Response</code>
                in order to instruct the ServiceWorker whether to send the request
                to the network or return a mock response.

            <h3>Mock Weather API</h3>
            <p>
                This demo implements a Mock Weather API in order to provide us with fake
                weather information in response to requests, making testing of client side
                applications a lot easier and faster to develop front end applications,
                with no third party bandwidth usage. That's a yayyy for you and your company.

                <p>
                    Because of it being a Mock API, a random response within a fixed range is returned
                    everytime a request is sent.
