# Service Worker Lifecycle

A service worker experiment to go through the initialization lifecycle of
a service worker. Service workers are installed and then these service workers
are used to improve the user experience immensely for the people. 

ServiceWorkers can present a rapid upgrade to the users of a mobile web application
and are going to be the future of the web probably.

Main idea for this application is

- Experiment on the registeration of the service worker
- Demonstrate the stages of the service worker installation
- Handle messages, so the service worker can listen for appropriate events
- Show a notificiation about Service Worker being ready

Service Worker lifecycle itself is very important and can lead to important 
discoveries about what we intend to do with the application we are developing.

All these steps should be labelled appropriately, to demonstrate what we are going to do with them.
